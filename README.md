# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis


Based on the Amazon product and customer review data, I found that product characteristics and customer engagement vary across categories.

The average discount percentage differs significantly by category, with some categories showing much higher average discounts than others. Similarly, the number of products listed and the total number of reviews are unevenly distributed across categories, indicating varying levels of product offering and customer activity in different areas.

When looking at individual products, some stand out with the highest average ratings, suggesting strong customer satisfaction. Conversely, analyzing products with lower ratings could highlight areas for improvement. Certain products have accumulated a remarkably high number of reviews, indicating popularity and high customer engagement, even if their average rating isn't the absolute highest.

Examining pricing, we see variations in both the average actual price and discounted price across different product categories. A substantial portion of products (751) are offered with a discount of 50% or more. Products are distributed across different price range buckets, with a notable number falling into the higher price range.

The distribution of product ratings shows how frequently different rating scores occur, providing an overview of overall customer sentiment.

In terms of potential sales performance, the total potential revenue (calculated as actual price multiplied by rating count) varies significantly by category, highlighting which product areas might be the most lucrative based on current pricing and customer engagement levels.

Exploring the relationship between product rating and discount level, a scatter plot of the data did not reveal a strong linear correlation across all products.

Finally, I identified that 326 products have fewer than 1,000 reviews, indicating a segment of the catalog with lower customer feedback volume. We also pinpointed the top products when considering a combination of both rating and the number of reviews.

These findings provide insights into product performance, pricing strategies, and customer engagement across the Amazon product catalog, which can inform product improvement and marketing efforts.
